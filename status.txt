Michael Shkolnik- 

Project 1 works as required. It correctly understands if the password is weak and will keep prompting the user to re-enter until it is strong.
I added some general comments before the functions that explain what it does.

NOTE: when you copy and paste the code into VIM for some reason the comments get extended all the way. 
So you have to remove all the comments and then it works great. 
Also for some reason when you paste it into Vim the spacing and indexing gets messed up so I guess its something to do with the editor.
