# Password-Login
First project in C Systems Information Class. Fall 2022

Had to create a login promt that lets user create username and password.
Password properties:
 The restrictions that we define as our defined level of
strength of passwords is the following: the password must be at least eight characters long, and must include at
least one uppercase, one lowercase letter, and one digit. The password cannot contain any other characters than
letters and numbers. In addition, it must contain at least one string (consecutive letters) of at least four letters
long (uppercase letters, lowecase letters, or combination of both). Furthermore, the password should not contain
the username (usernames in our login program are not case-sensitive). Remember, failing to write this piece of
code in the program correctly may result in accepting weak and vulnerable passwords. Your code helps rejecting
such passwords.

In addition the user gets an opption to generate a defualt password that passses all of the above parameters.
